                    Lazada South East Asia Pte Ltd and its affiliates (collectively, the “Lazada Group”, “Lazada”, ”we”,

                    property rights (“IPR”)
                    and we take a serious stance when dealing with claims of IPR infringement on the e-commerce
                    platforms that we operate,

                    deemed necessary by
                    us, including but not limited to the initiation of civil or criminal proceedings by Lazada

                limited to:
                <br>
                <p>

                    trademark, to a product
                    or service to establish the origin of such product or service, and the application of such sign has
                    been
                    conducted
                    without the express or implied consent of the proprietor of the registered trademark, in relation to
                    the
                    goods or
                    services for which that trademark is registered, or to such goods or services that are closely
                    related
                    to the goods or
                    services registered;
                    <br>
                    (2) Listing products or services to which Users apply a sign or signs similar to a registered
                    trademark,
                    to a product or
                    service to establish the origin of such product or service, without the express or implied consent
                    of
                    the proprietor of
                    the registered trademark, in relation to the product or services for which that trademark is
                    registered
                    or to such goods
                    or services that are closely related to the goods or services registered, and there exists a
                    likelihood
                    of confusion on
                    the part of the public with regards to the origin of the product or services; or
                    <br>
                    (3) Listing products that comprise copyrighted subject-matter which has been reproduced without the
                    express or implied

                    <br>
                    (1) Using copyrighted subject-matter (e.g., photographs, drawings, videos) in the description of the
                    products or
                    services, without the express or implied consent of the owner of the copyright; or
                    <br>
                    (2) Using a sign or signs in connection with the description of products or services, and such signs

                    identical or
                    very similar to a registered trademark, and the application of such sign has been conducted without
                    the
                    express or
                    implied consent of the proprietor of the registered trademark, in relation to the goods or services
                    for
                    which that
                    trademark is registered and there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public with
                    regards to the origin,
                    endorsement or association of the product or services and the registered trademark.

                </p>
                <p>
                    III. Listing product or services which infringe upon other types of IPR, including:
                    <br>

                    recognized under
                    the laws of the country where the notice of infringement is filed, including, but not limited to,
                    the
                    patents,
                    registered designs, or any type of IPR recognized under law or by the final court order of an apex
                    court.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IV. Deceptive or misleading conduct, including:
                    <br>
                    (1) Publishing product descriptions or other information which are misleading or misrepresentative

                </p>
                <br>
                B. Types of notices not accepted by Lazada
                <br>
                <p>
                    I. Distribution Agreements
                    br
                    We respect the rights of brand owners, manufacturers, trading companies and / or distributors to
                    enter
                    into agreements
                    in relation to how their products should be distributed (such as exclusive distribution agreements).
                    However, violations
                    of such agreements do not constitute IPR infringement. As the enforcement of agreements relating to
                    the
                    distribution of
                    products is a matter between the parties to such agreements, we do not assist with this type of
                    enforcement activity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    II. Compatibility
                    <br>
                    Lazada does not enforce notices of infringement seeking to remove or alter true statements
                    indicating
                    compatibility with
                    trademarked products. If a product detail page clearly and truthfully represents that the product
                    being
                    sold on that
                    page is compatible with a trademarked product, Lazada will not process notices directed against the
                    use
                    of the
                    trademarked sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    III. Jurisdiction
                    <br>
                    If you are filing a notice to Lazada for the infringement of a registered trademark, patent or
                    design,
                    your registered
                    trademark, patent or design must be registered in the country where you are filing the notice of
                    infringement. Lazada
                    does not take action in respect of IPR infringement notices concerning registered trademarks,
                    designs,
                    or patents from
                    countries other than the country for which the takedown is requested. For example, if you are the
                    proprietor of a
                    trademark registered only in Thailand and you file a notice through the IPP Platform to remove a
                    listing
                    on the Platform
                    in Singapore, your notice will be unsuccessful.
                </p>


                <p>
                    IV. Parallel Imports
                    <br>
                    Except where expressly prohibited pursuant to the laws of the country where the IPR infringement
                    notice
                    is filed, Lazada
                    will not process notices directed against parallel import or grey market products in the countries
                    where
                    the Platform is
                    located.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    C. IPR Infringement Notices
                    <br>
                    TO SUBMIT A NOTICE OF IPR INFRINGEMENT, YOU MUST EITHER OWN, OR HOLD THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO, THE
                    IPR

                    SUBJECT OF THE INFRINGEMENT NOTICE OR BE AN AGENT WITH WRITTEN AND SIGNED AUTHORIZATION FROM THE
                    RIGHTS

                    EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE TO SUBMIT NOTICES ON ITS BEHALF.
                    <br>
                    If you suspect that your IPR have been infringed by Users, you may submit IPR Infringement Notices
                    to
                    Lazada. Please
                    refer to Submitting IPR Infringement Notices to Lazada for details.
                    <br>
                    Users may file appeals where the content, or product or service listing(s), which Users have
                    uploaded
                    have been removed
                    from the Platform as a result of notices filed by rights holders. Users should refer to the relevant
                    section of Lazada
                    University in Seller Center for more information regarding the appeal process. Where appeals by
                    Users
                    are successful,
                    Lazada will reinstate the content, or product or service listing(s), which has been removed.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    D. Miscellaneous
                    <br>
                    (1) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT LAZADA HAS THE RIGHT TO FULLY AND FINALLY INTERPRET AND / OR
                    IMPLEMENT, OR WITHHOLD
                    FROM IMPLEMENTING, ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF ANY CONTENT, OR PRODUCT
                    OR
                    SERVICE LISTINGS
                    FROM THE PLATFORM, THE RIGHT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ANY USER (WHETHER ON THE PLATFORM OR OTHERWISE),
                    TO
                    REJECT ANY
                    NOTICE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT FOR THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION AT LAZADA’S SOLE
                    AND
                    ABSOLUTE
                    DISCRETION.
                    <br>
                    (2) Lazada reserves the right to amend this policy in accordance with changes to laws and
                    regulations,
                    changes in
                    business environment or at its sole and absolute discretion. We will announce all changes to this
                    policy
                    by posting
                    updates. The amended version of this policy will come into force on the date specified in the
                    announcement. Your
                    continued use of the Platform, including accessing or visiting the Platform in any way, following
                    the
